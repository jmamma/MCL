MCL 2.60 15/02/2019

Note: MCL update 2.60, requires that you upgrade your Machinedrum to OS version 1.70.

Changes:

  - The Trigger Interface is now supported natively, removing all limitations associated
    with the original exploit.

    You can now freely manipulate the MD GUI and parameters when using pages
	that use the trigger interface.

	Tracks will no longer switch when the TI mode is enabled.

  - Track Select: Track selection is now synced with the MD.

    To change tracks in the sequencer pages, simply change track on the MD.
    A new Global->Machinedrum menu item "Track Select" has been added.
	Default is Auto. "Man" will disable the track synchronization between the MD and MCL.

  - Auto save option is now deprecated.

    MCL will no longer save/overwrite your kit data.

    MCL no longer auto-saves the current kit to get the active kit data.
    Similarly, writing/chaining tracks to the MD will no longer auto-save the
    kit and instead will only modify the loaded kit data.

- Step Edit

  Parameter locks can now be added from the Step page by holding a trig and
  rotating a MD parameter.

- Mixer Page:

    CTRL All. Select multiple tracks in the Mixer Page, adjusting any MD parameter
    will change the same parameter across the selected tracks.

- Wav Designer.

    The MD's buttons and encoders will no longer become unresponsive after transmitting samples.

MCL 2.51 05/01/2019

Bug fix release:

   - Poly mode would not work unless MD was restarted, fixed.

   - Poly voice select is now accessible from Chromatic Page by pressing [
   Save + Write|Chain ]

   - Chromatic Page: Changes to voice selection.

       If current track is a poly track, then select voices from the poly
       tracks. Otherwise if current track is not a poly track use the current track
       as a monophonic voice.

       When MD is set to be controlled by external midi, only the poly voices
       will be playable.

   - Check parameter lock destinations more carefully before sending.

   - Prevent MCL from sending bogus LFO destination track which could cause MD
     lockup.

   - Sequencer notes would occasionally drop out when using page_select page.
   fixed.

   - Chaining an entire row, and then immediately pressing play on the MD
     could cause corrupt sysex data to be sent to the MD, causing loud noises
	 and an abrupt pattern change. fixed.

MCL 2.40 25/06/2019

Important:

Write mode has been removed completely. MCL will no longer transmit
pattern data to the MD.

You must now use Chain Mode and the internal sequencer.

When saving tracks from the MD you can merge sequencer data in to the
internal sequencer using the MERGE option, in the SavePage.

Fixes + Enhancements:

CuePage is now RoutePage:

    CuePage has been replaced with a generalised Audio Routing page, and
    now works correctly with chain mode.

MutePage has been deprecated:
    Sequencer mutes are replaced with audio mutes.
    Audio mutes are now controlled through the MixerPage and RoutePage.

Parameter lock behaviour now follows the MD Sequencer implementation more
closely.

SeqParam/Rlck Page changes:
    Pressing [ Chain | Write ] button will clear lock params in reverse
    order until none are present.

    Don't allow parameter locking of LEV

Sequencer Pages:

    Added SeqPage GUI for length and current track;

    [ Shift 2 ] + [ Trigger ] = Quick Track Select. Works with A4 as well.

    [ Shift 1 ] + [ Trigger ] = Set Track Length to selected step. (Offset by current
    page)

    [ Shift 1 ] + [ Shift 2 ] + [ Trigger ] = Set All Tracks (of same device type) to
    selected step

    Added one-shot trigs to conditional trig options.

MixerPage:
    [ Shift 2 ]  now reverts FLTF FLTW FLTQ settings for selected tracks.
    Values are cached when entering MixerPage.
    This is useful for creating filter sweeps then 'drops'.

    Mutes are now audio mutes, not MD sequencer mutes.
	Save button now allows solo-ing of selected tracks.

Loudness Page fixes:

    Analyzer was broken-ish. Record track would not trigger correctly.

    Boosting loudness whilst sequencer was running could send corrupt
    pattern data to the MD.

General:

- Convert lowercase to uppercase when transmit kitname
- Fix: filebrowser would not allow access to parent dir
- Low level ISR code re-written for faster execution.
- Low level Memory code improved for faster execution.
- Data structure for MIDI are now stored in second memory bank.
- Lowlevel MIDI code improved for faster execution
- Sequencer code re-written for faster execution
- Code base has been made compatible with original Minicommand hardware.
- Fix: midi tempo calculation, during midi continue.
- Fix: various bugsa and edge cases in Chain mode, manual and automatic.
- Fix: SeqExtPage bad character glitch
- Fix: SeqParam page showing param values offset by 1.
- Fix: SeqParam page not allowing selection of all 24 params
- Fix: reolution bug causing glitched track length for A4/Ext tracks
- Fix: Grid copy + paste was broken. Would not copy sequencer data correctly.
- Diversion track for MDExploit no longer fixed to track 16, will be
calculated dynamically
- Improved PageSelect page naming.
- Kit autosave now occurs before entering all pages ensuring kit data
is up-to-date.
- AUTO merge is now default behaviour, the option is removed from chain menu
and is instead accessible from Save Page.

MCL 2.31 16/04/2019

Fixes:

Mixer Page:

- Faster encoder rotation is now supported, by pressing the encoder button
and rotating. (When tracks are selected using trigger interface)

- Encoder 2 now adjusts FILTF for selected tracks.
- Encoder 3 now adjusts FILTW for selected tracks.
- Encoder 4 now adjusts FILTQ for selected tracks.

Chain Mode/Grid:

- Clear row now works correctly. Was incorrectly leaving slots active and
showing them as deleted. This messed up some chain mode behaviours.

- When a row is cleared completely, the row name is now initialised.

Internal Sequencer:

- Reduced sequencer muting/skipping when entering pages.

Write Mode:

- Fix write mode reliability

It was discovered that due to improvements in MIDI performance
in the MCL firmware, write mode became unreliable when sequencer was running. The
MD is unable to receive pattern/kit dumps at 4x or above turbo when
sequencer triggers are being executed. To circumvent this problem
we've added throttle to Write Mode, to limit data transfer rate when the
sequencer is live. The throttle is only activated during pattern/kit sends.

- Improve handling of empty slots: Writing an empty slot will now transmit GND
machine to MD.

- P+/P- modes were broken when chain mode was added (fixed)

- Pattern selection encoder on Write Page was incorrectly limited to 8 instead of 16.

MIDICtrl Core:

- New Memory layout.

Sysex code refactored to use HIGH memory bank. This frees up a signifcant
amount of RAM in the heap.

This change was made in preparation for handling larger sysex dumps from
newer elektron machines.

MCL 2.30 20/03/2019

Features and Fixes:

- Chain Mode Improvements: Chain mode no longer saves and requests the
current kit when sequencer is running. This fixes some complications with
parameter locks, and also improves chain page responsiveness.

Track muteGroups and trigGroups are now properly removed.

- MIDI SDS Receive is fixed and working.

- Added Loudness Page, and loudness features

  Auto Normalize: When activated,  all saved track have their LEV boosted to
  127, and parameters controlling VOL (including parameter locks) are lowered
  to compensate. VOL parameter locks and LFOs with destination VOL are
  adjusted too.

  The resulting track loudness remains the same, but the Track LEV parameter
  is no longer set arbitrarily. LEV == 127 will always be the loudest volume
  for a track.

  Gain Boost: The ability to boost / reduce the VOL of all tracks in the
  current kit by a percentage amount.

  Peak Analyser: The MD is instructed to record 1 Bar of the current pattern.
  The recording is transferred to the MegaCommand and the WAV file is decoded
  and analysed. The peak value in the recording is found and this is used to
  determine an appropriate gain boost to increase pattern/kit loudness using
  the Boost function above.

- Added Sound Page, to Page Select Menu.
  It's now possible to save and recall sounds from the MD. A sound consists of
  1 or more tracks (2 maximum).

  To save a sound enter the Sound Page. Select the desired track on the MD,
  and then choose save. If the selected track triggers another machine, both
  track machines will saved as part of the sound.

  To load a sound enter the Sound Page. Select the desired track on the MD,
  select the sound to be loaded from the browser, and press an encoder
  buttton.

- fixed unreliable button response in WavDesigner

- New file browser page, with memory improvements. 1024 files visble per
directory.

- Added the ability to rename rows.

- Added the ability to copy and paste slots within the grid

- Graphically depict slot selection when modifying slot_apply

- Fix for chromatic mode, tuning map was not available for ROM machines greater than 31

MCL 2.20 09/11/2018

###### IMPORTANT ######
   Projects created on older versions will not be compatible with MCL 2.20

Changes:

Stable support for 8x Turbo.
-  Significant improvments to the MIDI code now makes 8x Turbo
   the most stable speed setting.

   Choose this speed on both ports for lowest sequencer jitter and
   fastest transmission times.

GUI overhaul:
-  Both the HD44780 and OLED display get significant updates to the GUI
   to accomadate Chain mode. This includes a complete redesign of the
   menu system.

   The GridPage has been completely redisgned for both displays.

   Screensaver added for OLED display (5 minutes delay)

Slot menu:

-  To access the Slot menu:

    OLED_DISPLAY:

       Shift2 button will open the Slot menu for the selected slot.

    HD44780 LCD:

       Hold Shift 2 button + Encoder Button [ 1 - 4] will open the Slot menu
       for visible slots [ 1 - 4 ].

-  Slot Menu has following options and selectable values:
    Chain: [ --, auto, manual, random ]
    Loops:  (0, 64)
    Row:    (0,127)
    Seq: [ --, merge ]
    Clear: [ --, YES ]
    Apply: (0,20)

    Chain (global setting):
     - auto: enables chain auto mode global setting
     - manual: enables chain manual mode global setting
     - random: enables chain random mode global setting

    Loops: specify how many times to loop track/slot

    Row: specify which row to load/jump to after n loops.

    Seq: merge slot's MD sequencer data in to the internal sequencer

    Clear: clear the select slot.

    Apply: apply the above changes to the next N slots upon exit of SlotMenu.

Chain Mode:

  Chain Mode is enabled through the SlotMenu, or Global Settings->Chain Mode
  menus.

  Chain Mode is an enhancement of the default MCL write mode. It works
  like an old school music tracker. Tracks from different rows can be chained
  together and made to load automatically.

  Previously, when 'writing tracks' the MD pattern data would be transmited to
  the MD, and the corresponding internal sequencer data would be loaded along side it.

  When chain mode is enabled, only the MegaCommand internal sequencer data is 
  loaded and used to sequencer the Machindrum. By performing all the MD sequencing 
  from the MegaCommand we can load tracks instantaneoulsy without any audible delay.
  In addition, individual tracks can be chained together to form complex sequences or
  songs.

  To use chain mode, you must first "merge" your MD pattern data in to the
  internal sequencer. To do this, you can enable the "auto-merge"
  setting in the MachineDrum global settings page. If auto-mege is enabled,
  any time you save a track to the MegaCommand, the MD sequencer data will be
  merged in to the internal sequencer track for that slot.

  The SlotMenu can also be used to merge sequencer data on specific slots or
  entire rows. (see slot menu above)

  Chain mode resembles an old school music tracker. From the slot menu
  you can set the duration for which a track should play by setting the number
  of loops. The row value specifies which row of the Grid the track should
  load next after it has completed.

  Chain mode can be configured in 1 of 4 ways [ --, auto, manual, random ]
  If Chain mode is disabled then the write page performs as per pervious
  versions.

  If Auto mode is selected. Tracks written through the WritePage,
  will automatically load other tracks based on their Loop and Row settings.

  If Manual mode is selected, tracks will only be loaded through the Write
  page. (Useful if you want to pause the chaining functionality)

  If Random mode is chosen, tracks will automatically load based on random
  loop and row settings limited by parameter range in Global->ChainMode menu.

  When Chain mode is activated, the Write Page now displays "Chain".
  The quantization options behave slightly differently in Chain mode.
  In Chain mode, tracks will start playing from step 0 based on the
  step quanitzation.

GridPage Changes:

  The current active slot will blink.

  On the OLED display, the current Bar:Beat is shown.
  The next transition Bar:Beat is displayed below this.

Poly Config

  Voice selection is now achieved through the MD triger interface.
  Enter Global -> Machinedrum -> Poly Config.
  Selected tracks will be used as polyphonic voices for chromatic modes.
  If no tracks are selected, the current MD track is played monophonically.

BugFixes:

Numerous bug fixes and enhancements. See the git log

MCL 2.16a 10/08/2018

Hotfix:

Write original would be broken in some scenarios.

MCL 2.16 08/08/2018

Changes:

Improvements to the behaviour of Parameter Locks.

- Track parameters with paramter locks now have their correct default
  values detected. The default value is restored when the sequencer is
  stopped, or on next trig without a lock.

  Previously, saving the current kit or writing track to the current
  pattern would incorrectly cause the 'default' parameter value to change
  to the last parameter lock value sent.

SeqStepPage:

- TrigLocks are now cleared when a trig is set, not when a trig is deleted.

Bug fixes:

- MDExploit track switching improved.

MCL 2.15 01/08/2018

##### Important #######

OLED Display is now the default display type.
- See Readme on how to enable HD44780 LCD

- Grid Write and Save Pages GUI changes:
  Precision mode is now enabled by holding shift1 button in either page.
  Shift2 button will "write/save" original, which means all tracks and master
  settings.
  Encoder buttons no longer save or write tracks.

Kit auto-save enabled by default.

- If auto-save is enabled and the sequencer is stopped, the current kit will be
  saved when entering sub pages. This is necessary to detect kit changes
  such as machine change, or masterfx changes.

- Current kit is saved when storing track from the MD when autosave is
  enabled.
- Current kit is always saved when writing tracks to the MD regardless of
  autosave setting.

- SystemConfig updated requiring new Project Creation on startup.

Stability:

- Minimum sequencer jitter and best overall firmware performance is acheived
  when Turbo Midi is set to 4x. 8x turbo may not provide any performance
  benefit.

MD SDS Bug:

- If MD sysex data is requested at a time proceeding a sample request,
  the MD encoders and trigs lock up indefinately after the sample is received.
  The only current workaround is to power cycle the MD after receiving a sample.

##### Features Added #####

Quick PageSelect:

- Holding Shift Button 1 now accesses a page quick select menu.

- When inside the page select menu:
  MD trigger buttons 1 -> 16 can be used to select various pages quickly.
  Rotary encoder 1 can be used to scroll through available pages.
  Releasing Shift Button 1 enters the selected page.

- Currently (Mute, Mixer, Cue and Wav Designer) pages are accessible through
  this menu.

Wav Designer.

- Accessible from QuickPageselect menu above.

- 3 Oscillator Additive Synthesiser. Generates single cycle waveforms and sends
  them to a MD sample slot.

- There are 4 pages to the WavDesigner.
  Encoder buttons[1-3] select the indivdual oscillators.
  Oscillator Pages:
    - Oscillator wavform can be changed by pressing top left button repeteadly.
    Oscillator WAV Forms:
	  - SIN: Sine wav with adjustable overtones (each overtone is an octave above
        fundamental)
      - TRI
      - PULSE
      - SAW
      - USR: User defined waveform, 16 points with linear interpolation.

    - The MD trigger interface together with encoder 4 can be used to
      manipulate the SIN and USR waveforms.
    - Encoder 1 pitch adjusts frequency by semitone.
    - Encoder 2 is fine tune +-100 Cents
    - Encoder 3 is pulse width.

  Oscillator Mixer Page:
    - The wav designer mixer page has volume levels for each of the oscillators.

	- From the mixer page, top right button can be used to render and transmit the waveform.
      (Some of the  MD GUI will lock up when receiving samples, see bug description
	  above)
	- Encoders 1-3 adjust oscillator volume
	- Encoder 4 adjusts MSD destination sample slot.

Mute Page:

- A replacement for the MD mute menu. This features quantisation modes.
  Also LVL function sets the track(s) volume to 0 before unmuting, mixer
  page can then be used to fade in the track(s) gently.
- MCL will attempt to detect the current mute state. (No way of receiving it
from the MD)

Mixer Page:

-  For OLED users this will depict both mutes and levels.
-  Track triggering is displayed visually.
-  Holding Write Button when pressing MD trigs will toggle mutes according
   to settings in the Mute Page.

Chromatic mode:

- Chromatic mode will be functional from pages outside of PTC page.

- MD POLYSTART parameter added. When a POLYSTART value is chosen, Tracks
  from (POLYSTART to POLYSTART + POLYMAX) will be locked in as chromatic
  tracks. Playable from most pages if an external keyboard is attached.

- When modifying paramters from a chromatic track, the corresponding parameter
  on remaing poly tracks are updated simultanously.

Display Mirror:

- When enabled, the MC will transmit a 7bit encoded dump of the display over
  usb-serial which can be viewed using the mc_display_mirror.py script.

Midi Forward:

- Ability to forward all MIDI messages (except clock/realtime) to alternate
  port. Useful if you want to use the MD with the MC and an attached controller.

Enhancements Bug Fixes + Changes:

- Sample Support.
  MidiSDS sample format send/rec supported. Used for Wav designer.
  WAV file library has been added. should support 8->24bit samples multi
  channel.

- OLED SPI frequency doubled. Noticed that the default SPI speed for the OLED
  library was only 4Mhz. Increased to 8MHz. Might provide a small improvement
  to refresh rate.

- Re-drawing of display is disabled in Live Record mode when sequencer running.
  To improve MIDI input latency the OLED display is only updated when changing
  paramter values. This greatly reduces MIDI latency during live record mode.

- Mixer page encoder behaviour improved. large jumps in encoder values are
  supported and midi CC messages are interpolated between to give smooth
  value change.

- Chromatic mode extended to the Seq Step page. Encoder 4 is used to
  select Note of current step (uses one parameter lock track)
  External MIDI keyboard on port 2 can also be used to set note value.

- Improvement of Sequencer GUI. Parameter changes are now applied immediately
  upon encoder change.

- ExtSeqPage had some GUI problems. Fixed.

- Improvement to Project page GUI. Can now exit load and new project
pages. New project page shows a blinking cursor for the current character
select.

- GridWrite Page P+/P- modes were broken.

- GridWrite Page: When writing: If MD track length is shorter than the current pattern
  length, the selected tracks will automatically loop until they fill up the remaining
  pattern steps.

- Sequencer stability improvement, no more missing notes.

- Sequencer Track Length adjustment fixes.

- Improvements to sequencer parameter locks and pitch handling.

- Macros to control MD GUI.
  Discovered undocumented sysex commands that allow for controlling of MD GUI.
  Used to exit menus and record mode in the MD before enabling Trigger Exploit.

- Various improvements to the Trigger Exploit.

- Changes to ActivePeering for better connectivty and device identificaiton.

- Various other improvements I can't remember. See GitLog.
