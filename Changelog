MCL 4.00 20/06/2021

- Enhanced GUI / Machinedrum GUI convergance.
 Version X.05 of the MD firmware introduces a third editing mode beyond Classic and Extended
 entitled Enhanced Mode.

 Enhanced mode is activated automatically when the MD is connected to the MegaCommand.

 When in Enhanced mode, both Classic and Extended LEDs will be lit. The three modes can be
 toggled using the Classic/Extended button.

 Enhanced mode enables the Machinedrum's GUI to be fully integrated in to the MCL workflow
 All MD sequencer editing commands now apply to the MCL sequencer.
   This includes:
      - [ Record ] button to enter/exit step editing.
	  - [ Function + Record ] to enter realtime record mode (on any page).
	  - [ Function + Clear/Copy/Paste ] works across pattern/track/page/step.
	  - [ Step + Left/Right ] Microtiming menu drawn on the MD.
	  - [ Step + Up/Down ] Conditional trig selection.
	  - [ Function + Left/Right ] shift track.
	  - [ Function + Up ] reverse track.
	  - Step sequencer cursor is now fully synced with the MC.
	  - Parameter lock editing now works identically to the MD.
      - Track length and speed settings can be set via the MD's scale menu.
	    When in step edit mode, this applies to a single track otherwise it
		will apply to all MD tracks.
	  - Track sequencer data is automatically copied to new pages when extending a track's
	    length for the first time.

   MCL commands:
      - [ Song Button ] opens Page Select page.

      Grid Page:
	  - [ Up/Down/Left/Right ] navigate the grid by positioning the grid cursor.
	  - [ Bank Buttons ] navigate the grid (in bank increments).
	  - Hold [ No ] button opens Slot Menu.

	  Loading/Saving:
	  - [ Yes ] opens Load Page. Press and hold [ Yes ] again for Group Load menu.
	  - [ Function + Yes ] opens Save page. Press and hold [ Yes ] again for Group Save menu.
      - You can now load patterns/rows in the traditional MD way using the [ Bank + Trig buttons ].
	    -- [ Bank + Trig ] group loads the selected row, from the MCL grid.
        -- [ Bank + Multiple Trigs ] creates a chain queue consistencing of consecutive group
		   loads corresponding rows.

      Load Page:
	  - [ Bank Buttons ] can be used to select chain mode: Manual, Auto or Queue.

	  Slot Menu: Hold [ No ] button to open
	  - [ Up/Down/Left/Right ] to select multiple slots in the grid.
	  - [ Clear/Copy/Paste ] to clear/copy/paste selected slot(s)
	  - [ Yes ] load selected slots. Slots are loaded according to the Chain settings in the LoadPage.

	  Mixer Page:
	  - [ No + Trig ] revert parameter edits.

- Changes:
 Grids A/B are now relabelled to X/Y.
 Grid rows are no longer labelled numerically and instead represented by the corresponding

 Bank + Pattern.

 For example:

    Row 0   = A01
    Row 1   = A02
    Row 2   = A03
    ...
    Row 15  = A16
    Row 16  = B01
    Row 17  = B02
    ...
    Row 127 = H16

 Slot Menu:

 Added Len parameter for adjusting a slot's length without loading.
 Row parameter has been named to Jump. In Chain Auto mode, the Jump parameter corresponds to the
 destination of next slot transition.

- Chain Mode Enhancements:

 Each column in the grid now has it's own dedicated chain setting. It can be either Manual, Auto or Queue.

 Chain Queue is a new mode that has been added for realtime looping.

 Each column of the Grid can have up to 8 slots queued at any time. Queued slots are played in order
 and then the sequence is repeated indefinately.

 When Queue mode is selected from the Load page, each loaded slot will be added to the corresonding column's
 queue.

 A column's queue can be cleared by switching chain mode to either Manual or Auto and then loading a slot in
 that column.

 As each column has an independent chain setting, it is possible to have some slots chaining automatically
 (Auto) according to their Loop/Jump setting, other slots can be looping in an improvised queue (Queue),
 and then the remaining slots could be left static via manual chain (Manual).

- Load Page:

 [ Encoder 1 ] of the load page is used to select the applied Chain Mode when loading.
 Manual/Auto/Queue are selectable.

 When Queue mode is selected [ Encoder 2 ] becomes accessible and can be used to override the length of
 queued tracks.

- Sequencer Improvements:

 The sequencer is now pre-rendered: Each frame of the sequencer is generated one clock tick in advance.
 This means the MIDI payload is sent immediately on each clock pulse eliminating sequencer jitter.

 MD drum sounds are now triggered in parallel using a modification of the MIDI note-on specification.
 This eliminates phase distortion that could previously be heard on drum sounds playing on the same step.

 Each sequencer track now has it's own dedicated Arpeggiator. Adjustments made to Arpeggiator menu settings
 will be applied to the current track's Arp.
 Note: Arpeggiator data is not currently saved with the track data.

- Other Changes:

 Received MIDI data is now processed whenever possible and is no longer
 subject to program behaviour. This means MIDI receive latency will be the same across all MCL pages
 and the display refresh no longer needs to be locked during live record. If
 you are triggering chromatic mode from external MIDI keyboard/sequencer,
 expect note latency/jitter to be consistent no matter which page/mode you are in.

 MIDI Forwarding has been re-implemented and will no longer result in corrupted message streams.

 SD Card data access has been made robust to tranisent read errors. For best SD Card performance,
 ensure the card is formated FAT32 via the SD Card Foundations formatting utility.

 MCL no longer requires a dedicted MD global and will only modify settings as
 needed.

 MCL will automatically detect kit model changes eliminating the need to
 re-enter pages to refresh the kit state.

 RAM page transitions now occur immediately, instead of delaying an additional
 cycle.

 When assigning a Machine to the MD, parameters of the current sound will not be altered.
 This greatly improves the smoothness of slot loading.

 Poly mode voice algorithm improved.

 When using an external MIDI keyboard, scales are now padded across 12 notes for more enjoyable playing.

Deprecated Features:

- Chain RAND has been deprecated.
- Parameter Lock page has been deprecated.
- SD Card drive (MD backup tool) has been deprecated.

MCL 3.10 05/03/2021

  MCL 3.10 requires that your Machinedrum is upgraded to firmware version X.04

 Machinedrum:
  - Added support for the new MD machines: GND-SNPRO, GND-PUL, GND-SW

 Chromatic:
  - Added support for MD tonal tuning. For compatible machines, the tuning setting
  is automatically saved with the slot's sound data.
  - If the machine's tuning setting is TONAL then the new quater tone, equal temperament
  tuning table will be used.
  - If the machine's tuning setting is DEFAULT the legacy microtonal tuning table is used.
  - Increased display refresh latency in favour of much lower MIDI note latency.

  Piano Roll:
  - Fixed external MIDI key note mapping offset.
  - FYI: Chromatic settings [ scale ] + [ octave ] are applied to incoming MIDI notes from port 2.

  Sequencer Step Edit:
  - Added Trig Preview: hold trigger button and press enter on the MD.
  - Rotate sequencer by holding Function and pressing Left or Right on the MD.
  - Toggle between sequencer pages by pressing SCALE on the MD

  Chain Mode:
  - Fixed transition timing issues which could result in tracks going out of
  sync when chaining slots.
  - Fixed sending a garbled Kit Name when chaining an empty row.

  MIDI:
  - Optimized lower level MIDI code and reduced payload sizes for faster data
  transfer: means tighter chain transitions.
  - MIDI clock synchronisation now correctly handles phase resets from non MD devices.

  Project Conversion:
  - Fixed a bug when converting projects from 2.X -> 3.0 that would cause
  ghost tracks to appear in the new project. If you noticed that project
  conversion was not satisfactory, then it is advised that you re-convert the
  old 2.X project using firmware 3.10


MCL 3.01a 09/01/2021

Hotfixes:

- PianoRoll automation record was broken.
- PianoRoll length parameter was limited to 127, should have been 128 steps.
- When loading empty Ext MIDI tracks, preserve MIDI channel setting.

MCL 3.01 02/01/2021

  MCL 3.01 will prompt you to create a new project on startup, this is a
  formality as the system config file that stores Global Settings will be re-initialised.

  MIDI Active Peering:

    Added a new option for configuring the MIDI port 2 device.

    Global Settings -> MIDI -> DEVICE 2

    Set to either: [ General MIDI (Gener) ] or [ Elektron (Elekt) ]

    This option sets the default MIDI driver for port 2. Supported Elektron devices have
    more advanced features such as retaining kit/sound data when saving/loading slots,
    The general MIDI driver will only save/load MIDI sequencer data.

    If you are intending to pair your Megacommand with an Elektron device
    (MNM, A4) set this to Elektron.

    For all other MIDI devices, set this to General MIDI (new default setting).

  PianoRoll:

    Added MIDI Program Change as a CC destination.
    (Slides are disabled for Program Change).

  GridPage:

	Rename row now applies to grids A + B simultaneously.

  Fixes:

    - Ext MIDI tracks would not save or load correctly due to lack of
	connectivity. (See MIDI active peering above to set driver type).
    - A4 sound data would not load correctly in a variety of circumstances.
    - Improvement to chain mode transition behaviour.

MCL 3.00x 26/12/2020

Hotfixes A -> D

- MCL would freeze if Ext MIDI channel was greater than 6
- Ext MIDI tracks would not save correctly for generic devices.
- Ext MIDI tracks would cause MCL to crash on chain.
- Project Rename was broken in 3.0
- Polypage incorrect LED mode.
- Illuminate LED2 when REC mode is activated.

MCL 3.00 20/12/2020

  MCL 3.00 requires that your Machinedrum is upgraded to firmware version X.03

  Projects:

    Version 3.00 features a new project format. Projects created in earlier
    versions of MCL must be converted to the new format.

    Historically, projects have been stored in the root directory of the SD Card i.e
    "/my_project.mcl"

    In 3.0 new and converted projects are now stored in the /Projects/ directory.

    Each project has its own folder, inside the project folder there are 3 files:

      \Projects\new_project_000\
                                |- new_project_000.mcl   <- Project master file
                                |- new_project_000.0     <- Grid A data
                                |- new_project_000.1     <- Grid B data

  Project Conversion:

    Version 2.X projects can be converted to the 3.0 format using the "CONVERT PROJECT"
    menu option in Global Settings. Project conversion is non-destructive, your original 2.X
    files will remain in the root directory of the SD Card.

    When initiated, project conversion will create a new project subdirectory
    under \Projects\, create the necessary project files and then migrate the 2.X data across.

    Projects created in version 3.0 are not compatible with earlier version of MCL.

  Grid A + B:

    There are now 2 grids per project. Grid A and Grid B.
    Grid A is used to store 16 MD tracks.
    Grid B is used to store 6 External MIDI tracks + 4 AUX tracks.

    From the Grid Page, use the chain menu (accessible by holding [ shift 2 ])
    to switch between Grids A and B.

  New AUX (Auxiliary) Track Types:

    MDFXTrack   (FX): Store and recall MDFX (MachinDrum MasterFX: Delay, Reverb, EQ, Dynamics)
    LFOTrack    (LF): Store and recall LFO page data.
    RouteTrack  (RT): Store and recall MD Track Routing and Chromatic Mode's Poly settings.
    TempoTrack  (TP): Store and recall Tempo.

    AUX Tracks are positioned on Grid B and occupy slots 12 to 15.
    AUX Tracks can be saved/loaded/chained like regular tracks, so that you can automate
    loading of LFOs, TrackRouting, MDFX and tempo.

 MIDI Devices + Grid:

    MCL Firmware has been rewritten to dynamically support various MIDI devices.

    When connected, each device is allocated to a collection of pre-defined slots
	on Grid A and/or B.

    For example. The MD (Machinedrum) device has slots 0 to 15 reserved on Grid A.
	Slot 14 on Grid B is allocated to the MDFX track type.

    The Analog 4 or MNM will reserve slots  0 to 6 on Grid B.

    Similarly, a generic MIDI device will use slots 0 to 6 on Grid B.

  ClipBoard:

    Copy and paste of Grid Slots will adhere to the slot allocation rules described in the
	previous section.

  Save Page + Load Page (Formerly Write Page):

    By popular request, the Write page has been renamed to Load.

    Saving and Loading actions apply to the current Grid.

    When in the Save or Load Page, the [ Shift 1 ] button can be used to
    toggle between Grid A or Grid B.

    Slots from both grids can be selected before releasing all MD trigs to Save/Write.

  Group Select:

	When in the Save or Load Page, holding the [ Shift 2 ] button now opens a Group Select menu,
	allowing you to load or save all tracks corresponding to a group.

    There are four groups:

      1) MIDI Device 1 (MD)
	  2) MIDI Device 2 (A4/MNM/Generic)
	  3) FX (MDFX + LFOTrack + RouteTrack)
	  4) TP (Tempo)

    The groups can be enabled/disabled using the MD's trigger interface.

    Releasing [ Shift 2 ] will save/load tracks corresponding to the active groups.

  MD Sequencer:

    The MD sequencer has been re-designed. Each track supports 8 parameter lock destinations.
    There are a maximum of 256 locks per track, shared between each of the 8 parameters.

    Slide editing is now functional across the full 64 steps of the sequencer.

  Ext MIDI Sequencer:

    The External (Ext) Midi Sequencer has been re-designed.

    There are 6 x Ext MIDI Sequencer Tracks. These are stored in Grid B, slots 0 to 5.

    Each Ext MIDI track can be used to sequence an attached MIDI device on port 2.
    This could be an Elektron Analog 4, Elektron Monomachine or a generic MIDI device
    such as a synth module.

    Features of the new Ext MIDI Sequencer:
      - 6 x Tracks
      - 128 steps per track
	  - 512 events per track.
      - A maximum of 16 events per step, (i.e 16 note polyphony)
	  - Each event could be an automation parameter or note_on/note_off message.
      - Microtiming per event
      - Conditional trig per event
      - Velocity per step
      - Each track includes 8 MIDI Control Channel automation parameters with
      optional slide (linear interpolation).

  PianoRoll + Automation Editor:

    To accompany the new Ext MIDI Sequencer tracks we have created a PianoRoll
    editor which can be used to edit the sequences for Ext MIDI Tracks 1 to 6.

    The editor features an interactive cursor, controllable using [ Encoder 1 ]
    and [ Encoder 2 ].

    [ Encoder 1 ] cursor horizontal position
	[ Encoder 2 ] cursor vertical position
    [ Encoder 3 ] cursor width.
    [ Encoder 4 ] increase/decrease zoom.

    [ Write ] add note
	[ Write ] delete note ( deletes all notes overlapped by cursor )

    [ Shift 2 ] pianoroll menu.

    - PianoRoll Menu:

      Holding [ Shift 2 ] opens the PianoRoll menu. From here you can change
	  the current Track and the selected Edit Mode. For each track you can adjust the
      MIDI Channel, track length and playback speed. Cursor editing options are also included
	  here including note velocity and note conditional settings.

    - MD Trigger Interface Cursor Control:

	  The cursor can be positioned horizontally by pressing MD trigger buttons.
	  The cursor can be positioned vertically by playing notes on the attached MIDI device.

	  Note width can also be adjusted by holding one MD Trigger button and then
	  pressing another.

	  An attached MIDI Keyboard can be used to enter notes into the sequence.
	  Notes can be added by holding MD trigger buttons in conjunction with
      pressing notes or chords on an attached MIDI device.

    - Automation Editing:

	  The piano roll editor allows for automation editing.

      From the PianoRoll Menu's "Edit" parameter, you can select to Edit Automation Parameters
	  1 to 8.

      Slide enables/disable interpolation between automation events.

      The CC option allows a specific MIDI Control Channel number to be chosen
      per parameter, Alternatively you can select LEARN, to Automatically learn the next
	  received CC.

  Record Page: (Deprecated)

    The record page has been removed.

    Track recording can now be engaged from the StepEdit page or the PianoRoll editor by
	pressing [ Save ].

    Both automation (parameter locks) and note data can be recorded simultaneously in this
	mode.

    Pressing [ Write ] during a recording will clear the sequence for the current track.

  WavDesigner GUI:

    WavDesigner button assignment has changed.

    Shift 2 now opens a menu for selecting Oscillators 1 to 3, or the Oscillator Mixer sub
	pages.

    The oscillator's WaveForm is selectable from the shift-menu.

    The rendered waveform can be transferred to a MD sample slot using the
    shift menu's "TRANSFER" option accessible from the Oscillator Mixer
    sub page.

    [ Save ] can be used to toggle between oscillator pitch / frequency
    [ Write ] conveniently opens the MD's sample slot menu.

  MD Trigger Interface:

    The integration with the MD trigger interface has been improved. When editing a sequence
	on the MC the MD's LEDs will illuminate according to the pattern sequence on the MC.

    The MD's cursor (indicating current sequence position) will also be
	illimunated during playblack. The cursor is synced to the MD's current pattern speed + length.

    When using the Trig Interface to select tracks, the LEDs will illuminate appropriately.

    The trig interface will now automatically exit recording/mute menus when activated.

  Misc:

    MixerPage - [ Shift 2 ]: Undo functionality deprecated.

    Machinedrum - [ Function ] + [ Extended ] will now restore kit parameters
    to the state of the last chain/load from MCL.

  Other:

    Numerous bug fixes, refactors and optimizations have been performed during this
    release. If you encounter bugs, please try and reliably replicate the problem
    and submit a new "issue" on github.

MCL 2.70 21/06/2020

Changes:
  - Sequencer:
    * Added sequencer support for track speeds 1x, 2x, 3/4x, 3/2x, 1/2x, 1/4x, 1/8x
    * Added sequencer support for parameter slides. (Slide data is only retained for first 32 steps)
    * StepEdit page can now be toggled to edit either Trigs, Locks, Slides or Mutes.
      The "Edit" parameter controlling the edit mode is accessible from the StepEdit page's Track Menu.
    * Added ^ trig conditions (L1^, L2^, L3^.. etc).
      When chosen the step's parameter locks or slides must also obey the trig condition.
    * Sequencer step glyphs have been improved for each of the edit modes.
    * Added visual feedback when setting parameter slides using MD encoders.
    * uTiming window is now improved and supports various track speeds.
    * MD pattern speed + slides now imported to sequencer tracks when saving from the MD.

  - Chromatic/Arpeggiator:

    * The focused chromatic voice is now selected when notes are played in the chromatic page.
      This prevents the chromatic voice changing unintentionally when switching tracks on the MD.
      Similarly when playing from Ext Keyboard, you can only change the focused chromatic voice(s)
      from within the Chromatic Page.
    * Arpeggiator now runs in either standard or triplet time depending on track
      speed.
    * Arpeggiator max speed is now doubled. Use 2x track speed to record at this rate.

  - Chain mode:
    * Transitions now support all new track speeds.
    * Grid copy/paste of slots now translates chain ROW positions such
      that new ROW position is offset relative to the paste position.
    * A slot's Chain ROW and LOOP settings are retained when saving a slot in SavePage.

  - Main:
    * Allow simultaneously send & receive of MIDI_CLOCK on port 2. (Previously silently disabled to prevent feedback loop).

Bug Fixes:

  - Write/Save Pages
    * Entering write page would incorrectly change SavePage mode.
    * Swing would be applied to wrong trigs when saving from MD.

  - Sequencer:
    * Trig Conditions L3, L5, L6, L7 were all broken. Fixed.
    * Fixed an SRAM issue causing sequencer corruption on track 9.
    * Improved sequencer editing

  - Chain Mode:
    * In some circumstances chaining an empty track would result in unpredictable behaviour.
    * Updating chain ROW/LOOP settings could resurrect a previously cleared slot.
    * Oneshot masks are now cleared on chain transition
    * When chaining slots, only send machine parameters if track's sound is not equal to current track.
      (This was previously broken in some scenarios, resulting in no sound transition)

  - LFOs:
    * LFOs would incorrectly wrap around to 0 when they exceeded 127 in amplitude. Fixed.

  - Chromatic/Arpeggiator:

    * When connecting device to MIDI port 2, active "Peering" notification would appear frozen on chromatic page.

MCL 2.62 08/05/2020

Changes:

  - Add transpose parameter to Chromatic Page. Accessible from the Track Menu.

Bug Fixes:

  - Chromatic Page
    * Note to PTC mapping was incorrect. (Wrong note displayed on keyboard,
	machine base pitch not taken into consideration)
    * Arpeggiator and Scales broken when using EXT MIDI. Fixed.
    * Ext MIDI now responds from NOTE C2 and upwards. Scales are mapped across each note of keyboard and root is at C2.
    * Poly config saved when exiting poly select page.
    * Notes out of machine range, now result in silence, as opposed to playing highest note.
    * Some tweaks to behaviour of the arpeggiator GUI.
    * Clearing or adjusting length of poly tracks was broken.

MCL 2.61 16/03/2020

Changes:

  - Arpeggiator added to Chromatic Page. Accessible from the Track Menu.
  - MIDI CC can be used to control MD Parms across poly tracks.
    CC 16 to 40 controls MD Params 1 to 24.
  - Added many more scales to Chromatic Page
  - Chromatic Page now indicates when in POLY mode.
  - Added support for TRX-S2

Bug Fixes:

  - Peering was broken in certain pages. Fixed
  - Fixed PolyPage selection bugs.


MCL 2.60 15/02/2019

Note: MCL update 2.60, requires that you upgrade your Machinedrum to OS version 1.70.

Changes:

  - The Trigger Interface is now supported natively, removing all limitations associated
    with the original exploit.

    You can now freely manipulate the MD GUI and parameters when using pages
	that use the trigger interface.

	Tracks will no longer switch when the TI mode is enabled.

  - Track Select: Track selection is now synced with the MD.

    To change tracks in the sequencer pages, simply change track on the MD.
    A new Global->Machinedrum menu item "Track Select" has been added.
	Default is Auto. "Man" will disable the track synchronization between the MD and MCL.

  - Auto save option is now deprecated.

    MCL will no longer save/overwrite your kit data.

    MCL no longer auto-saves the current kit to get the active kit data.
    Similarly, writing/chaining tracks to the MD will no longer auto-save the
    kit and instead will only modify the loaded kit data.

- Step Edit

  Parameter locks can now be added from the Step page by holding a trig and
  rotating a MD parameter.

- Mixer Page:

    CTRL All. Select multiple tracks in the Mixer Page, adjusting any MD parameter
    will change the same parameter across the selected tracks.

- Wav Designer.

    The MD's buttons and encoders will no longer become unresponsive after transmitting samples.

MCL 2.51 05/01/2019

Bug fix release:

   - Poly mode would not work unless MD was restarted, fixed.

   - Poly voice select is now accessible from Chromatic Page by pressing [
   Save + Write|Chain ]

   - Chromatic Page: Changes to voice selection.

       If current track is a poly track, then select voices from the poly
       tracks. Otherwise if current track is not a poly track use the current track
       as a monophonic voice.

       When MD is set to be controlled by external midi, only the poly voices
       will be playable.

   - Check parameter lock destinations more carefully before sending.

   - Prevent MCL from sending bogus LFO destination track which could cause MD
     lockup.

   - Sequencer notes would occasionally drop out when using page_select page.
   fixed.

   - Chaining an entire row, and then immediately pressing play on the MD
     could cause corrupt sysex data to be sent to the MD, causing loud noises
	 and an abrupt pattern change. fixed.

LFO Page:
  A single global LFO (Lower frequency oscillator) page is provided which can
  be used to manipulate any MD parameter, either a Track Param or Global FX.
  Two destinations are selectable and a variatey of wave shapes available.
  The LFO can be triggered by a dedicated 16 step sequencer track, or be set
  to run freely.

Firmware Performance & MIDI Timing :
  Improvements to the low level MIDI interrupt code means reduced latency and
  tighter sequencer performance.
  Faster GUI routines, means higher framerate and snappier performance.
  Improved latency coompensation for realtime recording on Chromatic and
  Record pages.
  Device peering now works from any page.
  Numerous bug and workflow fixes.

MCL 2.40 25/06/2019

Important:

Write mode has been removed completely. MCL will no longer transmit
pattern data to the MD.

You must now use Chain Mode and the internal sequencer.

When saving tracks from the MD you can merge sequencer data in to the
internal sequencer using the MERGE option, in the SavePage.

Fixes + Enhancements:

CuePage is now RoutePage:

    CuePage has been replaced with a generalised Audio Routing page, and
    now works correctly with chain mode.

MutePage has been deprecated:
    Sequencer mutes are replaced with audio mutes.
    Audio mutes are now controlled through the MixerPage and RoutePage.

Parameter lock behaviour now follows the MD Sequencer implementation more
closely.

SeqParam/Rlck Page changes:
    Pressing [ Chain | Write ] button will clear lock params in reverse
    order until none are present.

    Don't allow parameter locking of LEV

Sequencer Pages:

    Added SeqPage GUI for length and current track;

    [ Shift 2 ] + [ Trigger ] = Quick Track Select. Works with A4 as well.

    [ Shift 1 ] + [ Trigger ] = Set Track Length to selected step. (Offset by current
    page)

    [ Shift 1 ] + [ Shift 2 ] + [ Trigger ] = Set All Tracks (of same device type) to
    selected step

    Added one-shot trigs to conditional trig options.

MixerPage:
    [ Shift 2 ]  now reverts FLTF FLTW FLTQ settings for selected tracks.
    Values are cached when entering MixerPage.
    This is useful for creating filter sweeps then 'drops'.

    Mutes are now audio mutes, not MD sequencer mutes.
	Save button now allows solo-ing of selected tracks.

Loudness Page fixes:

    Analyzer was broken-ish. Record track would not trigger correctly.

    Boosting loudness whilst sequencer was running could send corrupt
    pattern data to the MD.

General:

- Convert lowercase to uppercase when transmit kitname
- Fix: filebrowser would not allow access to parent dir
- Low level ISR code re-written for faster execution.
- Low level Memory code improved for faster execution.
- Data structure for MIDI are now stored in second memory bank.
- Lowlevel MIDI code improved for faster execution
- Sequencer code re-written for faster execution
- Code base has been made compatible with original Minicommand hardware.
- Fix: midi tempo calculation, during midi continue.
- Fix: various bugsa and edge cases in Chain mode, manual and automatic.
- Fix: SeqExtPage bad character glitch
- Fix: SeqParam page showing param values offset by 1.
- Fix: SeqParam page not allowing selection of all 24 params
- Fix: reolution bug causing glitched track length for A4/Ext tracks
- Fix: Grid copy + paste was broken. Would not copy sequencer data correctly.
- Diversion track for MDExploit no longer fixed to track 16, will be
calculated dynamically
- Improved PageSelect page naming.
- Kit autosave now occurs before entering all pages ensuring kit data
is up-to-date.
- AUTO merge is now default behaviour, the option is removed from chain menu
and is instead accessible from Save Page.

MCL 2.31 16/04/2019

Fixes:

Mixer Page:

- Faster encoder rotation is now supported, by pressing the encoder button
and rotating. (When tracks are selected using trigger interface)

- Encoder 2 now adjusts FILTF for selected tracks.
- Encoder 3 now adjusts FILTW for selected tracks.
- Encoder 4 now adjusts FILTQ for selected tracks.

Chain Mode/Grid:

- Clear row now works correctly. Was incorrectly leaving slots active and
showing them as deleted. This messed up some chain mode behaviours.

- When a row is cleared completely, the row name is now initialised.

Internal Sequencer:

- Reduced sequencer muting/skipping when entering pages.

Write Mode:

- Fix write mode reliability

It was discovered that due to improvements in MIDI performance
in the MCL firmware, write mode became unreliable when sequencer was running. The
MD is unable to receive pattern/kit dumps at 4x or above turbo when
sequencer triggers are being executed. To circumvent this problem
we've added throttle to Write Mode, to limit data transfer rate when the
sequencer is live. The throttle is only activated during pattern/kit sends.

- Improve handling of empty slots: Writing an empty slot will now transmit GND
machine to MD.

- P+/P- modes were broken when chain mode was added (fixed)

- Pattern selection encoder on Write Page was incorrectly limited to 8 instead of 16.

MIDICtrl Core:

- New Memory layout.

Sysex code refactored to use HIGH memory bank. This frees up a signifcant
amount of RAM in the heap.

This change was made in preparation for handling larger sysex dumps from
newer elektron machines.

MCL 2.30 20/03/2019

Features and Fixes:

- Chain Mode Improvements: Chain mode no longer saves and requests the
current kit when sequencer is running. This fixes some complications with
parameter locks, and also improves chain page responsiveness.

Track muteGroups and trigGroups are now properly removed.

- MIDI SDS Receive is fixed and working.

- Added Loudness Page, and loudness features

  Auto Normalize: When activated,  all saved track have their LEV boosted to
  127, and parameters controlling VOL (including parameter locks) are lowered
  to compensate. VOL parameter locks and LFOs with destination VOL are
  adjusted too.

  The resulting track loudness remains the same, but the Track LEV parameter
  is no longer set arbitrarily. LEV == 127 will always be the loudest volume
  for a track.

  Gain Boost: The ability to boost / reduce the VOL of all tracks in the
  current kit by a percentage amount.

  Peak Analyser: The MD is instructed to record 1 Bar of the current pattern.
  The recording is transferred to the MegaCommand and the WAV file is decoded
  and analysed. The peak value in the recording is found and this is used to
  determine an appropriate gain boost to increase pattern/kit loudness using
  the Boost function above.

- Added Sound Page, to Page Select Menu.
  It's now possible to save and recall sounds from the MD. A sound consists of
  1 or more tracks (2 maximum).

  To save a sound enter the Sound Page. Select the desired track on the MD,
  and then choose save. If the selected track triggers another machine, both
  track machines will saved as part of the sound.

  To load a sound enter the Sound Page. Select the desired track on the MD,
  select the sound to be loaded from the browser, and press an encoder
  buttton.

- fixed unreliable button response in WavDesigner

- New file browser page, with memory improvements. 1024 files visble per
directory.

- Added the ability to rename rows.

- Added the ability to copy and paste slots within the grid

- Graphically depict slot selection when modifying slot_apply

- Fix for chromatic mode, tuning map was not available for ROM machines greater than 31

MCL 2.20 09/11/2018

###### IMPORTANT ######
   Projects created on older versions will not be compatible with MCL 2.20

Changes:

Stable support for 8x Turbo.
-  Significant improvments to the MIDI code now makes 8x Turbo
   the most stable speed setting.

   Choose this speed on both ports for lowest sequencer jitter and
   fastest transmission times.

GUI overhaul:
-  Both the HD44780 and OLED display get significant updates to the GUI
   to accomadate Chain mode. This includes a complete redesign of the
   menu system.

   The GridPage has been completely redisgned for both displays.

   Screensaver added for OLED display (5 minutes delay)

Slot menu:

-  To access the Slot menu:

    OLED_DISPLAY:

       Shift2 button will open the Slot menu for the selected slot.

    HD44780 LCD:

       Hold Shift 2 button + Encoder Button [ 1 - 4] will open the Slot menu
       for visible slots [ 1 - 4 ].

-  Slot Menu has following options and selectable values:
    Chain: [ --, auto, manual, random ]
    Loops:  (0, 64)
    Row:    (0,127)
    Seq: [ --, merge ]
    Clear: [ --, YES ]
    Apply: (0,20)

    Chain (global setting):
     - auto: enables chain auto mode global setting
     - manual: enables chain manual mode global setting
     - random: enables chain random mode global setting

    Loops: specify how many times to loop track/slot

    Row: specify which row to load/jump to after n loops.

    Seq: merge slot's MD sequencer data in to the internal sequencer

    Clear: clear the select slot.

    Apply: apply the above changes to the next N slots upon exit of SlotMenu.

Chain Mode:

  Chain Mode is enabled through the SlotMenu, or Global Settings->Chain Mode
  menus.

  Chain Mode is an enhancement of the default MCL write mode. It works
  like an old school music tracker. Tracks from different rows can be chained
  together and made to load automatically.

  Previously, when 'writing tracks' the MD pattern data would be transmited to
  the MD, and the corresponding internal sequencer data would be loaded along side it.

  When chain mode is enabled, only the MegaCommand internal sequencer data is 
  loaded and used to sequencer the Machindrum. By performing all the MD sequencing 
  from the MegaCommand we can load tracks instantaneoulsy without any audible delay.
  In addition, individual tracks can be chained together to form complex sequences or
  songs.

  To use chain mode, you must first "merge" your MD pattern data in to the
  internal sequencer. To do this, you can enable the "auto-merge"
  setting in the MachineDrum global settings page. If auto-mege is enabled,
  any time you save a track to the MegaCommand, the MD sequencer data will be
  merged in to the internal sequencer track for that slot.

  The SlotMenu can also be used to merge sequencer data on specific slots or
  entire rows. (see slot menu above)

  Chain mode resembles an old school music tracker. From the slot menu
  you can set the duration for which a track should play by setting the number
  of loops. The row value specifies which row of the Grid the track should
  load next after it has completed.

  Chain mode can be configured in 1 of 4 ways [ --, auto, manual, random ]
  If Chain mode is disabled then the write page performs as per pervious
  versions.

  If Auto mode is selected. Tracks written through the WritePage,
  will automatically load other tracks based on their Loop and Row settings.

  If Manual mode is selected, tracks will only be loaded through the Write
  page. (Useful if you want to pause the chaining functionality)

  If Random mode is chosen, tracks will automatically load based on random
  loop and row settings limited by parameter range in Global->ChainMode menu.

  When Chain mode is activated, the Write Page now displays "Chain".
  The quantization options behave slightly differently in Chain mode.
  In Chain mode, tracks will start playing from step 0 based on the
  step quanitzation.

GridPage Changes:

  The current active slot will blink.

  On the OLED display, the current Bar:Beat is shown.
  The next transition Bar:Beat is displayed below this.

Poly Config

  Voice selection is now achieved through the MD triger interface.
  Enter Global -> Machinedrum -> Poly Config.
  Selected tracks will be used as polyphonic voices for chromatic modes.
  If no tracks are selected, the current MD track is played monophonically.

BugFixes:

Numerous bug fixes and enhancements. See the git log

MCL 2.16a 10/08/2018

Hotfix:

Write original would be broken in some scenarios.

MCL 2.16 08/08/2018

Changes:

Improvements to the behaviour of Parameter Locks.

- Track parameters with paramter locks now have their correct default
  values detected. The default value is restored when the sequencer is
  stopped, or on next trig without a lock.

  Previously, saving the current kit or writing track to the current
  pattern would incorrectly cause the 'default' parameter value to change
  to the last parameter lock value sent.

SeqStepPage:

- TrigLocks are now cleared when a trig is set, not when a trig is deleted.

Bug fixes:

- MDExploit track switching improved.

MCL 2.15 01/08/2018

##### Important #######

OLED Display is now the default display type.
- See Readme on how to enable HD44780 LCD

- Grid Write and Save Pages GUI changes:
  Precision mode is now enabled by holding shift1 button in either page.
  Shift2 button will "write/save" original, which means all tracks and master
  settings.
  Encoder buttons no longer save or write tracks.

Kit auto-save enabled by default.

- If auto-save is enabled and the sequencer is stopped, the current kit will be
  saved when entering sub pages. This is necessary to detect kit changes
  such as machine change, or masterfx changes.

- Current kit is saved when storing track from the MD when autosave is
  enabled.
- Current kit is always saved when writing tracks to the MD regardless of
  autosave setting.

- SystemConfig updated requiring new Project Creation on startup.

Stability:

- Minimum sequencer jitter and best overall firmware performance is acheived
  when Turbo Midi is set to 4x. 8x turbo may not provide any performance
  benefit.

MD SDS Bug:

- If MD sysex data is requested at a time proceeding a sample request,
  the MD encoders and trigs lock up indefinately after the sample is received.
  The only current workaround is to power cycle the MD after receiving a sample.

##### Features Added #####

Quick PageSelect:

- Holding Shift Button 1 now accesses a page quick select menu.

- When inside the page select menu:
  MD trigger buttons 1 -> 16 can be used to select various pages quickly.
  Rotary encoder 1 can be used to scroll through available pages.
  Releasing Shift Button 1 enters the selected page.

- Currently (Mute, Mixer, Cue and Wav Designer) pages are accessible through
  this menu.

Wav Designer.

- Accessible from QuickPageselect menu above.

- 3 Oscillator Additive Synthesiser. Generates single cycle waveforms and sends
  them to a MD sample slot.

- There are 4 pages to the WavDesigner.
  Encoder buttons[1-3] select the indivdual oscillators.
  Oscillator Pages:
    - Oscillator wavform can be changed by pressing top left button repeteadly.
    Oscillator WAV Forms:
	  - SIN: Sine wav with adjustable overtones (each overtone is an octave above
        fundamental)
      - TRI
      - PULSE
      - SAW
      - USR: User defined waveform, 16 points with linear interpolation.

    - The MD trigger interface together with encoder 4 can be used to
      manipulate the SIN and USR waveforms.
    - Encoder 1 pitch adjusts frequency by semitone.
    - Encoder 2 is fine tune +-100 Cents
    - Encoder 3 is pulse width.

  Oscillator Mixer Page:
    - The wav designer mixer page has volume levels for each of the oscillators.

	- From the mixer page, top right button can be used to render and transmit the waveform.
      (Some of the  MD GUI will lock up when receiving samples, see bug description
	  above)
	- Encoders 1-3 adjust oscillator volume
	- Encoder 4 adjusts MSD destination sample slot.

Mute Page:

- A replacement for the MD mute menu. This features quantisation modes.
  Also LVL function sets the track(s) volume to 0 before unmuting, mixer
  page can then be used to fade in the track(s) gently.
- MCL will attempt to detect the current mute state. (No way of receiving it
from the MD)

Mixer Page:

-  For OLED users this will depict both mutes and levels.
-  Track triggering is displayed visually.
-  Holding Write Button when pressing MD trigs will toggle mutes according
   to settings in the Mute Page.

Chromatic mode:

- Chromatic mode will be functional from pages outside of PTC page.

- MD POLYSTART parameter added. When a POLYSTART value is chosen, Tracks
  from (POLYSTART to POLYSTART + POLYMAX) will be locked in as chromatic
  tracks. Playable from most pages if an external keyboard is attached.

- When modifying paramters from a chromatic track, the corresponding parameter
  on remaing poly tracks are updated simultanously.

Display Mirror:

- When enabled, the MC will transmit a 7bit encoded dump of the display over
  usb-serial which can be viewed using the mc_display_mirror.py script.

Midi Forward:

- Ability to forward all MIDI messages (except clock/realtime) to alternate
  port. Useful if you want to use the MD with the MC and an attached controller.

Enhancements Bug Fixes + Changes:

- Sample Support.
  MidiSDS sample format send/rec supported. Used for Wav designer.
  WAV file library has been added. should support 8->24bit samples multi
  channel.

- OLED SPI frequency doubled. Noticed that the default SPI speed for the OLED
  library was only 4Mhz. Increased to 8MHz. Might provide a small improvement
  to refresh rate.

- Re-drawing of display is disabled in Live Record mode when sequencer running.
  To improve MIDI input latency the OLED display is only updated when changing
  paramter values. This greatly reduces MIDI latency during live record mode.

- Mixer page encoder behaviour improved. large jumps in encoder values are
  supported and midi CC messages are interpolated between to give smooth
  value change.

- Chromatic mode extended to the Seq Step page. Encoder 4 is used to
  select Note of current step (uses one parameter lock track)
  External MIDI keyboard on port 2 can also be used to set note value.

- Improvement of Sequencer GUI. Parameter changes are now applied immediately
  upon encoder change.

- ExtSeqPage had some GUI problems. Fixed.

- Improvement to Project page GUI. Can now exit load and new project
pages. New project page shows a blinking cursor for the current character
select.

- GridWrite Page P+/P- modes were broken.

- GridWrite Page: When writing: If MD track length is shorter than the current pattern
  length, the selected tracks will automatically loop until they fill up the remaining
  pattern steps.

- Sequencer stability improvement, no more missing notes.

- Sequencer Track Length adjustment fixes.

- Improvements to sequencer parameter locks and pitch handling.

- Macros to control MD GUI.
  Discovered undocumented sysex commands that allow for controlling of MD GUI.
  Used to exit menus and record mode in the MD before enabling Trigger Exploit.

- Various improvements to the Trigger Exploit.

- Changes to ActivePeering for better connectivty and device identificaiton.

- Various other improvements I can't remember. See GitLog.
